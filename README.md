# Orion Recast

An special kind of currency converter

## About

You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the earth's population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that is left in your account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all over the galaxy to sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).\
Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers and units, and you decided to write a program to help you.

The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the [roman numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).
